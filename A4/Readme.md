This is code for A4 - it includes a `requirement.txt` for needed packages and some python files. 

start the main.py file using streamlit run in the terminal. 
```
streamlit run code/main.py
```

The other two python files contain functions that are called in the `main.py` file and create a simple web page (with not much functionality yet).
