Hello, my name is Madeline Mulder, but I also go by Maddy. The following are a few of my personal recommendations. 

My favorite quote is “Love and success, always in that order. It’s that simple and that difficult” by Mr. Rogers

I am not picky when it comes to food and will eat almost anything but I do not like black licorice. 

My recommendation if you are looking to read something funny and witty would be any book by Terry Pratchet.  

My favorite german word that I have learned so far is spaß ("fun").
